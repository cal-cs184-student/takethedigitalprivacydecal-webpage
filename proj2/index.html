<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we utilized de Casteljau's algorithm to draw Bezier curves and surfaces, and 
    implemented various operations for modifying triangle meshes. While implementing Bezier curves
    were straightforward, it was interesting to see how it could be expanded to drawing the Bezier
    surface as well. 
    <br>
    We found it difficult to implement the triangle mesh functions due to it being hard to visualize 
    the relationships between various arbitrary mesh elements and determine the cause of visual artifacts. 
    Especially with the loop subdivision section, it was unclear which part of the implementation was 
    broken and causing the image to become spiky (it ended up being that we iterated through halfedges 
    incorrectly, doing halfedge->vertex->halfedge and expecting it to go back to the original halfedge).
</p>
<br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    de Casteljau's algorithm consists of recursively dividing lines into segments by a proportion t
    (so that one segment has length l*t and the other has length l*(1-t)),
    then drawing a new line through the divisions, until there is one line left. The corresponding
    division point of that line is a spot on the bezier curve. 
    <br>
    To implement this, we store the list of vertices, construct line segments, and then perform the 
    recursive division and construction as described above. As t changes from 0 to 1, the final 
    point drawn traces the shape of the bezier curve, so we can draw the curve by drawing all points
    corresponding to 0 < t < 1. 
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    To extend de Casteljau's algorithm to a surface, we first use de Casteljau's algorithm
    with parameter u to get a set of bezier curves, which are defined by their control points.
     We then re-run the algorithm on that set of points with parameter v, which gives a point on the 
     bezier surface. Since our point is parameterized by both u and v, we know that this point corresponds
     to the point (u, v) on the bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We first iterate through all of the adjacent triangles to the vertex and grab 
    the area and normal of those triangles. We then calculate the area-weighted 
    vertex normal by multiplying those values together and aggregating them, then normalizing it.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement edge flipping, we first initialized all of the relevant vertices, edges, faces, and halfedges 
    and labelled them so that we would not lose track of what should go where. We then assigned all 
    relevant data to their respective mesh elements by following the diagram in the problem. Because we 
    reassigned everything, there were no problems caused by forgetting to assign an element to its new 
    states. 
    <br>
    While implementing this feature, there were problems with triangles disappearing and leaving a hole 
    in the mesh. We used the check_for() function on every element to make sure it was connected to the right 
    number of other elements, and found that certain halfedges pointed to the wrong next halfedge. 
</p>
<br>

<br>


<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Similarly to edge flips, we first initialize all mesh elements and label them, then constructed 
    all neccesary new mesh elements (the additional vertex, 2 faces, 3 edges, and their respective 
    halfedges). We then assigned all elements according to the diagram given in the problem. Because this 
    problem was similar to the previous problem, we used mostly the same format and only modified a few 
    elements which pointed to the wrong element. The majority of the new work was assigning pointers to 
    the newly constructed elements. 
    <br>
    Since this problem was similar to the previous task, it was fairly straightforward to implement 
    and only required making sure that every element pointed to the right number of other elements.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement loop subdivision, we first computed the new positions for all vertices in the original mesh, 
    where the new position was a sort of weighted average of its adjacent vertices and its original position. 
    We then calculated the position of any vertices that would be created, using another weighted average 
    of the vertices around the edge that would be split. We then iterated through every edge in the original 
    mesh and split it using the function from part 5. Because this splitting also created new edges that 
    would be added to the list to iterate through, we made sure to mark those edges as new and to not 
    split them further, preventing an infinite loop. After splitting an edge we store the position calculated 
    in the previous step inside the vertex (but not actually updating the position of the vertex yet). We then 
    flipped any new edge that connected an old and a new vertex. Finally, we updated all vertex positions with 
    the precomputed and stored values.
    <br>
    While debugging, we found that while it didn't seem like which halfedge a newly created vertex pointed to 
    would matter, it did cause our implementation to be off as the adjacent vertex that we thought was 
    close by was actually further away. Additionally, some of the hafledges were originally accessed using 
    edge->hafledge->vertex->halfedge (which was thought to be equivalent to edge->halfedge), but this resulted 
    in giving a different halfedge than expected because the halfedge tied to a vertex is basically random. 
    To debug problems we used the edge inspector and recorded the addresses of specific mesh elements, then 
    found them again after doing the loop subdivision process and checked if they were the expected values. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    When we perform loop subdivision on the torus, it becomes more rounded and loses its hexagonal shape. 
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="images/q6_1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Original torus</figcaption>
      </td>

        <figcaption>3 subdivisions</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  However, if we pre-split some edges on one side of the torus, it does not lose its shape on those side:
</p>

  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    We see that repeated subdivision of the cube results in an asymmetric shape:
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="images/q6_7.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Original cube</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/q6_8.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Cube after 3 subdivisions</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<br>
<p>
  This is due to the cube originally having an asymmetric set of triangles; each face is initially only split across 1 diagonal. 
  We can preprocess the cube by splitting each face into 4 triangles, which removes the asymmetry of the diagonal. 
  We see that this results in a much smoother shape:

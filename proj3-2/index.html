        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).

		<p><b>Overview</b></p>
		<p>
			In this project we implemented a few features to upgrade our existing raytracer (Project 3-1). We chose to add 
			reflective and refractive materials (part 1), and depth of field (part 4). This allowed us to generate 
			even more realistic looking images and in a variety of formats compared to the original raytracer. 
		</p>


        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

        <p><b>
            Show a sequence of six images of scene `CBspheres.dae` rendered with `max_ray_depth` set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light. Make sure to include all screenshots.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            In this section we implemented a thin-lens camera model to render the depth of field effect. 
			In the original ideal pinhole camera model, everything is treated as in focus. When we switch to a 
			thin-lens camera model, objects are only in focus if they are at a specific distance (the focal distance) 
			away from the lens. This causes certain areas of the scene to be in focus, and other areas to be blurry. 
			<br>
			To do this, we randomly sample a point on the thin lens (which has some area defined by the lens radius) 
			and calculate where it will intersect with the plane of focus. Because of the property that rays from the 
			same point on the plane of focus always focus to the same point on the image plane, we can just use the 
			pinhole camera model's intersection with the plane of focus as the intersection for the sampled point as well. 

        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            Here we have different depths in focus (depending on focal distance). We see that as focal distance 
			increases, a further back section of the dragon comes into focus. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Here we have different aperture sizes (depending on lens radius). We see that as aperture increases, 
			the area of the dragon that is in focus decreases (though the front belly of the dragon is always 
			in focus).

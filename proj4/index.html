		In this project we implemented a cloth simulator, which represents a cloth using a series of point 
		masses and springs, and is affected by forces such as gravity, springs, or collision with other objects
		(or the cloth itself). 
		We also implemented various types of shaders that can be used to display the cloth with different images, 
		colors, and lighting effects.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  </a>
  	<p>
		In this section we implemented a grid of point masses with springs attaching them. 
		The point masses were stored in a 1d vector in row-major order. For a horizontally placed cloth, 
		we distributed the point masses uniformly across the xz plane (with a constant y), and for 
		a vertical cloth, we distributed across the xy plane with a z coordinate chosen to be a small 
		random offset. We then attached structural, shearing, and bending springs to each point mass.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  </a>
  <p>
	In this section we implemented a cloth simulation that is affected by gravity and the spring forces 
	between point masses. In order to do this, we calculated the forces that would be applied to each mass 
	(as a result of gravity and spring forces) and applied them according to Verlet Integration, which 
	helps find the expected next position of the point mass. We also applied a small damping factor to 
	the simulation. Finally, we constrained the point masses to not move too far away from their adjacent 
	points by fixing the length of the spring to be at most 1.1 * the rest length. 
  </p>
    <blockquote><b>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. 
      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

    <p>
      When we change the spring constant to a low value, the cloth ends up with many wrinkles when at rest. 
	  When we use a large spring constant, the cloth seems very stiff and does not bend easily, with only 
	  one fold.

    <p>
		When we change the density to be a low value, the cloth is very light, and is not affected by 
		gravity as much. The final resting position's fold is not very deep, as the cloth does not 
		get pulled down as far. When we use a high density, the fold at the top becomes very deep.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  </a>
  	<p>
		In this section we implemented collision with spherical and plane objects. To do so, at every 
		simulation timestep, we check for potential collisions between every object and every point mass 
		in the cloth. To implement sphere collision, we check if the point mass is inside the sphere, 
		and if it is, we push it to the closest point on the surface of the sphere (plus a slight offset 
		so that the cloth is not directly on the sphere). This causes the falling cloth to rest on top 
		of the sphere. To implement plane collision, we check if the previous position and the new 
		position of the point mass are on opposite sides of the plane - if they are, that means the cloth 
		has travelled through the plane. We then push the point mass back to the surface of the plane, with a 
		slight offset towards the side that it came from, so that it is resting on top (opposite of whichever 
		direction gravity was) of the plane.

		We see that as the spring constant gets smaller, the cloth becomes more fluid and

      By varying the density, we change the mass of the cloth. With a lower density, the cloths has fewer and larger folds as it falls on itself. With a higher density, the cloths has more numerous, smaller folds as it falls on itself. By changing ks, we change the spring factor betwen the springs of the point masses that represent our cloth. With a lower spring constant, the cloth has less rigidity, and also has more numerous, smaller folds. With a higher spring constant, the cloth is more rigid, so it has fewer and larger folds.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a program that runs in parallel on the GPU and simulates lighting and texture effects on objects in a scene. The vertex shaders is the first part of the shader program and modify the geometries of the objects by changing position vertecies and direction normals, and it passes parameters to the second part, the fragment shader. The fragment shader is in charge of computing the color of each pixel in the final images.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a shading model that simulates the way light interacts with surfaces in a 3D scene. It is composed of 3 components: the ambient component, the diffuse component, and the specular component. The ambient component represents the universal lighting that is present everywhere. The diffuse component represents the light that is scattered in all directions off objects. The specular component represents the shiny light that is scattered in a single direction off objects. Different objects will have different ratios of the components depending on the surface texture.

    <p>
      Bump mapping and displacement mapping can both add rough surface textures to smooth surfaces efficiently. Bump mapping works by modifying the normals on the object without modifying the underlying gemoetry, allowing it to easily add slight rough texture to the object. Displacement mapping works by modifying the actual verticies of the object, and adjusting the normals to match afterwards, which makes it add much more realistic texture to the object.
    </br>
      The coarseness of the spheres had no effect on the bump map shader, but it had a large effect on the displacement map shader. This makes bump maps more versatile for all resolutions of objects, while displacement maps more suitable for high resolution objects. On a lower resolution object, the displacement map created a sort of spiky sphere and did not convey the brick texture well. On the higher resolution object, the displacement map worked very well, and the brick texture is very apparent. You can see the underlying geometry is modified as you can see inbetween the grooves of the brick texture.
